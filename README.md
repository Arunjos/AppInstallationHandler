### What is this repository for? ###

   This a simple system that developed to control illegal software installations. The user can only enter to the app using a password. This password is generated based on the systems mac id. So the password only works with that system. For maintaing this security we have created 2 apps KeyRequestor and KeyGenerator.

   KeyRequestor in users system will request a key with its mac id and KeyGenerator will help admin to generate a key specified to that system. It can't be used for other systems.
